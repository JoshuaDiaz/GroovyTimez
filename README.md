Our team being excited by the recent trend towards more active forms of entertainment, such as those provided by motion-control systems and virtual-reality headsets, set out to create a similar type of device. We were further inspired by the games Rhythm Heaven and Dance Dance Revolution, in which the different physical inputs made by the player worked to create a rhythm that the player essentially danced to. Thus, we formulated Groovy Times, a game in which the player is prompted by on-screen directions to move to a beat that their performance impacts the sound of. We made use of the PIC32 microcontroller, an MMA8451Q accelerometer, and two RF69HCW radios (connected through Arduino) to implement a fully untethered game that gets the player groovinâ€™ on their feet.
